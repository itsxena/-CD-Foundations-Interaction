        <h1>Journaling</h1>
        <p>Activities such as journaling can provide an outlet to vent your frustrations and anxieties that you would normally confront later on at night before bed. Writing down your fears of the future, finances, your occupation or the current political climate can clear your head, therefore promoting better quality of rest.

        <h1>Yoga</h1>
        <p>Physical activities such as exercising and yoga are great ways to release pent up anxiety or anger while also encouraging the production of endorphins. While physically combating and relieving stress at the moment, the long-term effects of endorphin production help increase mood and decrease stress that later causes sleeping issues.

        <h1>Aromatherapy</h1>
        <p>Aromatherapy helps relax the body and mind by releasing natural plant extracts into the air to promote health and well-being. It is helpful for unwinding and relieving any stress or tension before a night of rest.

        <h1>Establish A Routine</h1>
        <p>Establishing a routine allows for a chance to relax/calm down before bed and immediately after waking. A consistent schedule helps you regulate your body’s clock and can help promote sleep as well as staying asleep throughout the night.
